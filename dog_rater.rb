# 1. Write a method called basic_rating that takes in a dog's name and returns a string that says "_____ is a cute dog. ___/10"
#    For example, basic_rating("Spot") could return "Spot is a cute dog. 10/10"




# 2. Write a method called special_rating that takes in a dog's name, returns a better rating if the dog's name is one of your favorite names.




# 3. Write a method called ultimate_rating that takes in a dog's name and the dog's breed and returns a rating based on those two factors.
#    If the user doesn't specify the dog's breed, the method should default to assuming the dog's breed is "unknown".
#    If the dog's breed is a Corgi, give the dog a few bonus points.
